 <h1>Jewellery-Managment-System</h1>
 <p>
  This program allows the user to keep track of jewellery store inventory. Key features of the program inlcude: total inventory value, Cabinet & Shelf ID's & the ability to accessorise shelves and cabinets.I used SceneBuilder to design the interface & the program was written in Intellij. The application uses a linked list algorithm to connect jewellery items, to a display tray which is connected to a display case.
 </p>
 <p>
  The application has a basic CRUD system to manage the jewellery inventory. To start filling in Jewellery items, A case must first be added followed by a tray. The case can be customised from free-standing to wall-mounted and if it is lit or un-lit. Similarly, the trays can also be customised.

   A number of buttons are present on the 'Home' page. These include: a view stock button, a reset button (clears the objects from the linked list), a save button (saves the linked list to an xml file) and a load button (loads the last linked list back in to the program. At the top of the page, there are many tabs to choose from. These tabs represent the cases, trays and items and each have there own seperate functionality.

 On the jewellery item page, the three options to choose from are the 'Add Jewellery Item', this allows you to add and item to a specific tray in a specific display case (interface seen below),
 the 'Search Jewellery Item' allows you to search for all items based on the item type (Watch, ring, necklace e.t.c.) and will return a hierarchy style result of the items location.
